            <h4>Hi there! My Name is Pradeep and welcome to my learning journal</h4>
            <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, 
                <br>I've started understanding how life is full of enjoyment, thrilling and glad to learn with
                  like-minded peers. <a href="read more.html" target="_blank">Read More</a>

            <h4>How I stay committed to learning</h4>
            <p>
                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. 
                    I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned 
                    or work new techniques into existing projects.
                <span>
                    While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful 
                    to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
                </span>
            </p>
    
            <h4>How I got started</h4>
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. 
                I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, 
                I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                <span>
                    That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning 
                    summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.

                 <p> I started my journey into frontend development. 
                    I had been eager to learn how to create beautiful websites and web applications, 
                    and now was the perfect time to dive in.

                        I reminded myself that it's okay to make mistakes; after all, I'm just getting started.

                    distributing space became a breeze.</span>
